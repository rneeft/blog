### Random

Rules are a good start but break them when needed [*](https://youtu.be/4GK1NDTWbkY?t=41)

### Organisation

- **Squad** is a small cross-functional self-organising team. Sit together and have end-to-end responsibility, focus on product delivery. [*](https://youtu.be/4GK1NDTWbkY?t=63)
- **Chapter** is a competency area such as Quality assistance, Agile coaching or Web development.
- **Guild** a lightweight community of intrest where people across the whole company gather and share knowledge.[*](https://youtu.be/4GK1NDTWbkY?t=453)

### Feature Delivery

- No Handoffs
- Square owns the change from start to end
- Unmerged code hides problems and is a form of technical dept. Loosely coupled, tightly alisgned squads.[*](https://youtu.be/4GK1NDTWbkY?t=720)
- Frequent deliver removes the need of planning. See it as Release trains, if you miss a train just show up and take the next train.

### Limit the blas radius [*](https://youtu.be/rzoyryY2STQ?t=156)

- Via decoupled architecture
- Gradual Rollout

> "If everything is under control, you are going too slow"
***Mario Andretti*** [*](https://youtu.be/rzoyryY2STQ?t=201)

Fast Failure Recovery > Failure avoidance[*](https://youtu.be/rzoyryY2STQ?t=93)

### Changes

Innovation > Predictability [*](https://youtu.be/rzoyryY2STQ?t=318)
100% Prdeictability = 0% innovation

Should we need A or B, Don't know lets test and compare.[*](https://youtu.be/rzoyryY2STQ?t=439)

- What's the hypothesis?[*](https://youtu.be/rzoyryY2STQ?t=460)
- What did we learn?
- What will we try next?

Result: More data-driven decisions instead of

- Opinion-driven...
- ego-driven... or,
- authority-driven decisions.

If it works, keep it. Otherwise dump it.

### Definition of Awesome [*](https://youtu.be/rzoyryY2STQ?t=613)

Create a Definition of Awesome

> ***Awesome Architecture***
> - I can build, test and ship my feature within a week
> - I use data to learn from it and my improved version is live in week two

Healty Culure heals broken process.[*](https://youtu.be/rzoyryY2STQ?t=699)

***You are the culture, Model the behavior you want to see.***
